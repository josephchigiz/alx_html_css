# HTML Basics!
- Building a html-css project, while learning the basics.
- Here you find the implementation of,
  - tags  
  - normal elements 
  - self-closing elements  
  - attributes 
  - links
- The aim is to end up with a fully functional website/page where all these components have been implemented correctly.
- The code used for the pages in this build (found inside the <a href="./html_basic/">'html_basic'</a> dir) are:
    1. <a href="./html_basic/index.html">Main Page</a>
    2. <a href="./html_basic/tweets.html">Tweets Page</a>
<br>
<br>
- You can preview the <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/josephchigiz/alx_html_css/blob/master/html_basic/index.html"><em>rendered website</em></a> in it's current state, so that you can follow the development in real-time.
- As I go along, I'll spice up the pages with CSS and JS.
- ***Happy Coding!ðŸ«¡***
